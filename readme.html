glutamate.mod This is the simulated glutamate impact on the
postsynaptic cell via AMPA/NMDA receptors

Release parameters include 

del: delay for the first pulse
Tspike: interspike (presynaptic release) intervals
Nspike: number of presynaptic pulses
gNMDAmax and gAMPAmax: postsynaptic conductances, in case of NMDA, the
peak possible conductance. In this simulation AMPA conductance was set
to zero.
decayAMPA, decayNMDA: degree of short term plasticity of the
postsynaptic conductances, in the paper it was set to one (meaning
same intensity for all pulses).
taudAMPA,taudNMDA: timecourse of the short term plasticity


layerV.hoc
the morphology and the basec biophysical properties of the cortical
layer 5 pyramidal cell (not the same cell as used in the original
paper)

main.hoc (+ses)
the file that runs the simulation

In the simulation, the glutamatergic synapse is located on a basal
branch (dend[73]). Paired pulse stimulation elicits an NMDA spike with
stimulation >10nS. NMDA spike threshold with a single pulse is
~18nS. Depolarizing the soma to recreate the expected first stimulus
depolarization shifts the single pulse threshold to ~15nS.

Below is a table of NMDA receptor conductance and somatic
depolarization with paired pulse stimulation, single pulse and single
pulse +somatic current injection of 0.15nA

Usage:
------
After autolaunching or downloading and compiling the mod files
(nrnivmodl (linux), mknrndll (ms win or mac os x), running the
simulation (with Init & Run button) will produce this default graph:

An illustration analagous to fig 9 in the paper: turn "Keep Lines" on
in the graph through the pop up menu, set the gnmdamax and gampamax to
16; run the simulation. Then set NSpike to 1 and set both conductance
densities to 32 and run the simulation; these graphs should appear:
